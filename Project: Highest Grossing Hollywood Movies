This project was the final project of my course taught by Brainstation.
Our team use tools like Excel and Tableau to analise the data to answer the questions like:

"International sales follow domestic (US) sales?"
"Which kind of movie rating the audience preffer most?"
"Is the movie lenght a factor to big audience?"
"Which studio sells most?"
